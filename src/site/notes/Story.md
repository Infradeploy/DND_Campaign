Artefacts have been missing. The one in Bannockburn is one of them.

Secret organisation (Priory of Guhllaman) knows about them and is there to protect them from ever being used.  You need 13.

A warlock, corrupted by the craving of power was informed by a lesser demon. He started a cult with followers. They got enough power to collect the artifacts by infiltrating a church. Artifacts together form a summoning stone object to rise Asmodeus from the depth of hell.
