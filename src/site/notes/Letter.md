Hi friend,

Hope this letter finds you well. As you know I'm retired from adventuring,  and retreated to a little town called [[Places/Riverbed\|Riverbed]] in the [[Places/Valley of opulence\|Valley of opulence]]. The only way in and out of the valley is by river. I'm in need of your expert help here as some things are not quite right in this town. I can't elaborate on paper, but be sure the problem is dire and needs our attention. We'll discuss it with 2 big tankards of ale between us. I've asked some other trusted colleagues to join us. Meet me at my residence at your earliest convience, the sooner the better.  

Hope to see you soon,
Your friend [[NPCs/Hieronymous Thoke\|Hieronymous Thoke]]
